# Creeps

Creeps is a Dodge the Creeps implementation from the Godot basic 2d game tutorial [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

This is one of my first complete games (I have some small projects from my CC graduation)

## The game

The idea is to dodge all the enemies as long as possible. It's a quite hard game.

## Instalation

You can build the source with Godot by yourself or you can download the flatpak budle on the releases page and install with: `flatpak install -user <flatpakbundlename>`
